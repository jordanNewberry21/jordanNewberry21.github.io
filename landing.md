			<h2>What I've been up to</h2>
		</header>
		<p>I began learning to code like many people, by doing all the free tutorials I could get my hand on. First I learned some HTML tags, then I learned how to manipulate them with CSS. Then I picked up some javaScript, and learned how to use
		jQuery to make a dynamic web-page. That's just how it started, check out what I'm up to lately.</p>

					<h3>To-Do List App</h3>
				</header>
				<p>I built this app as part of a class project. I used node / express for the server, and used postgreSQL and pg for the database. The client-side code was built using javaScript with jQuery, and styled with bootstrap / vanilla CSS. I think it's a fun little app that looks cool. I deployed it with Heroku and I actually like to keep it loaded up on my phone. Click on the picture to see it in action on Heroku.</p>

					<h3>Server-Side Calculator</h3>
				</header>
				<p>This app was built to showcase my understanding of how data is communicated between the client and the server. The instructions for this project were to make sure that all the calculations were computed on the server with data from the client. The calculator itself only handles simple math equations, but it felt really good to get this one up and running. Click on the photo to see it in action on Heroku.</p>

					<h3>Pet Hotel Project</h3>
				</header>
				<p>This is another fun one I did for school. We had a short week so our instructors decided it would be fun to teach us python for a week. This one was really challenging, even as a group. We used python for the back-end server language, and had to figure out how to get that to communicate with jQuery ajax functions AND postgreSQL. It was a bit of a head-scratcher, but we got it to work, and I'm really happy with the finished product.</p>
