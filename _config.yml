# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values

# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  I am a professional Chef turned Software Developer. I spent
  over 10 years in the Twin Cities hospitality industry, working in some of the 
  more well-respected kitchens in the area. I wasn't seeing a lot of growth in hospitality, so I decided to just go for it and learn how to code!
  It's the best decision I've ever made.
  It has been quite the journey so far. I've been able to meet a lot of like-minded individuals from all kinds
  of backgrounds. I'm having a blast and I can't wait to bring this energy into the work force.
baseurl: "/home" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
